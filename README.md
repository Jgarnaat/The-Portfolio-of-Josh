# <Josh's Portfolio>

## Description

This is the beginning of my portfolio page, still a work in progress

- My motivation behind creating this was using elements of things that have influenced me throughout my life and try to style them in a way to bring that through 
- I build this so had a platform to not only test my knowledge but to showcase my skills

## Usage

The website is pretty straightforward. 
<br>I used the sticky position so the nav bar will reach a certain height and stick so it is available no matter where you are on the screen
<br>For projects 2-3 I used placeholder links and images as I do not have anything else to showcase as of yet and I didn't feel right using another project for the placeholder as this is my portfolio
